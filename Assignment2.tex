An urn contains 3 red and 7 black balls. Players $A$ and $B$ withdraw balls from the urn consecutively until a red ball is selected. Find the probability that $A$ selects the red ball. ($A$ draws the first ball, then $B$, and so on. There is no replacement of the balls drawn.)\\

We need to find the total number of outcomes where player $A$ wins and divide this by the total number of possible outcomes. \\
Every win for Player $A$ will be a string black balls selected ending with the selection of a red ball. Since there are only 7 black balls there can only be 4 chances. After the 4th chance all the black balls have been selected which forces player $B$ to select a red. The following lists all the possible outcomes by color.\\

\begin{tabular}{l c  l}
Outcome & Winner & Number of Outcomes \\ \hline
$(r)$ \quad & $A$ & outcomes = 3 \\
$(b,r)$ \quad & $B$ & outcomes = 7 $\cdot$ 3 = 21 \\
$(b,b,r)$ \quad & $A$ & outcomes = 7 $\cdot$ 6 $\cdot$ 3 = 126 \\
$(b,b,b,r)$ \quad & $B$ & outcomes =  7 $\cdot$ 6 $\cdot$ 5 $\cdot$ 3 = 630 \\
$(b,b,b,b,r)$ \quad & $A$ & outcomes = 7 $\cdot$ 6 $\cdot$ 5 $\cdot$ 4 $\cdot$ 3 = 2520 \\
$(b,b,b,b,b,b,r)$ \quad & $B$ & outcomes = 7 $\cdot$ 6 $\cdot$ 5 $\cdot$ 4 $\cdot$ 3 $\cdot$ 3 = 7560\\
$(b,b,b,b,b,b,b,r)$ \quad & $A$ & outcomes = 7 $\cdot$ 6 $\cdot$ 5 $\cdot$ 4 $\cdot$ 3 $\cdot$ 2 $\cdot$ 3 = 15120\\
$(b,b,b,b,b,b,b,b,r)$ \quad & $B$ & outcomes = 7 $\cdot$ 6 $\cdot$ 5 $\cdot$ 4 $\cdot$ 3 $\cdot$ 2 $\cdot$ 1 $\cdot$ 3 = 15120\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent Now we may calculate the probability: 
\[ P(A \; \text{wins}) = \frac{3+126+2520+15120}{3+21+126+630+2520+7560+15120+15120} = \frac{17769}{41100} \]

The second Earl of Yarborough is reported to have bet at odds of 1000 to 1 that a bridge hand of 13 cards would contain at least one card that is ten or higher. (By \emph{ten or higher} we mean that a card is either a ten, a jack, a queen, a king, or an ace.) Nowadays, we call a hand that has no cards higher than 9 a \emph{Yarborough}. What is the probability that a randomly selected bridge hand is a Yarborough?

 Compute the probability that a bridge hand is void in at least one suit. Note that the answer is not
\[ \frac{\binom{4}{1} \binom{39}{13}}{\binom{52}{13}} \]
(Why not?)
Hint: Use Proposition 4.4

Let E, F, and G be three events. Find expressions for the events so that, of E, F, and G,\\
(a) only E occurs;\\
(b) both E and G, but not F, occur;\\
(c) at least one of the events occurs;\\
(d) at least two of the events occur;\\
(e) all three events occur;\\
(f) none of the events occurs;\\
(g) at most one of the events occurs;\\
(h) at most two of the events occur;\\
(i) exactly two of the events occur;\\
(j) at most three of the events occur.\\

Let $f_n$ denote the number of ways of tossing a coin $n$ times such that successive heads never appear. Argue that
\[ f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} \quad n \ge 2, \; \text{where} \; f_0 \equiv 1, f_1 \equiv 2 \]

Hint: How many outcomes are there that start with a head, and how many start with a tail? If $P_n$ denotes the probability that successive heads never appear when a coin is tossed $n$ times, find $P_n$ (in terms of $f_n$) when all possible outcomes of the $n$ tosses are assumed equally likely. Compute $P_{10}$.

(Just for fun – not to hand in.) The following is a popular and rather instructive puzzle. A standard deck of 52 cards (26 red and 26 black) is shuffled so that all orderings are equally likely. We then play the following game: I begin turning the cards over one at a time so that you can see them. At some point (before I have turned over all 52 cards) you say “I’m ready!” At this point I turn over the next card and if the card is red, you receive one dollar; otherwise you receive nothing. You would like to design a strategy to maximize the probability that you will receive the dollar. How should you decide when to say “I’m ready”?
